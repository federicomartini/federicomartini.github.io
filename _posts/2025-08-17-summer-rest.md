title: "Consistency, Small Doses, and deserved rest"

This week I completed the assessment for the **AI Engineering with AWS Nanodegree at Udacity**.  
It was a mix of Python questions, basic AI concepts, and some LLM-related stuff.  
By the end of the month I’ll know if I got accepted or not. Fingers crossed!

## Experiments & Tests
None this week. Summer holidays hit hard

## Lessons Learned
- New things are best introduced in **small doses**.  
- Avoiding change can sometimes be a **healthy, conservative choice**.  
- Taking breaks matters — especially when it means spending time with family.  

This week we went to see the new **How to Train Your Dragon (live action)**.  
I loved that they stayed faithful to the original story instead of forcing “new twists” just for the sake of originality.  

It made me think: in tech (and in life), sometimes we push too hard to add our own “unique spin,” when in reality, people often value consistency more.  

- If you want to innovate, either do it on **entirely new products and technologies**, or introduce novelty in **small, careful doses**.  
- Consistency beats intensity. Taking a full week off from projects can be tricky — the dopamine drop is real, and getting back to the same rhythm takes time.  
- You don’t need to build something big every day. Even a **single line of code, a small commit, or a tiny step** keeps the momentum alive.  

Finding time isn’t always easy (especially with family and kids), but every time I do, it feels priceless — like fuel that keeps me going.  

## Ideas & Notes
- Learned that GitHub is now part of Microsoft’s **CoreAI team**. Honestly, I don’t see this as a problem.  
Open source has already been used to train models, licenses or not. I actually think this integration makes sense.  

- For me, **Generative AI is not a threat** — it’s an accelerator. It frees developers to focus on the high-level, creative parts of programming instead of boilerplate code.  

## Closing Thought
This week reminded me: progress doesn’t always mean chasing big changes.  
Sometimes it’s about **staying consistent**, making **small improvements**, and remembering that not everything needs to be “original” to be valuable.

Take care, and have a great week.
