# Sometimes Progress Means *Not* Buying the 64GB Mac

This week I finally made peace with something I’d been overthinking for months:  
No, I don’t need a Mac mini M4 Pro with 64GB of RAM.  
Even though that little voice in my head (and on every tech forum) kept saying, *“If you’re serious about AI, you need the best hardware money can buy.”*

## What I Realized
- You can do almost **everything for free** or with minimal resources — and scale up later.  
- The more you read online, the easier it is to get confused and think you “need” things you don’t.  

Honestly, my real win this week was way simpler: I [**redesigned my GitHub profile**](https://federicomartini.github.io).  
Bonus feature: you can now navigate menus using just number keys.

## What I Learned (Or Re-Learned)
- **Less is more** — research is great, but at some point you have to stop collecting information and just *do the thing*.  
- **Morning workouts** have been a game-changer for me — not for “productivity hacks”, but because it’s *my* time. I start the day slower, healthier, and with way more energy.

## On the AI Front
I followed the [**GPT-5** launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uu_VJeVVfo) closely… and honestly? It blew me away.  
However, I tested it a while, and at the moment I'm not so impressed. I also spotted more mistakes in Italian than with GPT-4o.
It's too early to end up with conclusion on this brand new (SOTA) model, though.

**Lesson:** newer isn’t always better.

Sometimes moving forward isn’t about doing more — it’s about **cutting the noise**.  
And yes, this week the noise was a shiny Mac I almost bought just to feel “more ready.”


I hope you found this article inspiring and helpful.
Take care, and have a great week.
