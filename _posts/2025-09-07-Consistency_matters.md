title: "Consistency Over Intensity: How I Got Sponsored by AWS"
date: 2025-09-07

When I applied for the AWS AI Engineer Udacity program, my thought was:"Let's try, but don't expect to pass to the next phase". 
Thousands of students try, only a few are selected.

Between a full-time job, family commitments, and the usual daily tasks, finding time to study wasn’t easy.  
I had to block small slots in my calendar — early mornings, late evenings, sometimes in between family errands.  
No big dramatic sacrifices, just consistent organization.

Step by step, I:
- finished the preliminary course,  
- delivered the projects,  
- passed the extra Python + GenAI entry test.  

And it worked: **I’ve been selected, and AWS is sponsoring my journey into cloud and AI/ML.**

The lesson for me is simple: **consistency beats intensity**.  
You don’t need to work 10 hours a day on something — you just need a plan, discipline, and the patience to keep showing up.

I’m sharing this not only to celebrate a personal milestone,  
but to remind anyone reading: progress is built in small, repeatable steps.

Take care and have a great week.

*P.S. I've done many other things this week, and I've an answer to many doubts I had. It's been a very productive week for many reasons. I'll share more details in the next posts (or commits).*
